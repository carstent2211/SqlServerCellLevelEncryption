# SqlServerCellLevelEncryption
Want your applications to handle db field encryption and decryption on demand? This is where cell level encryption comes in, and it is supported by SQL Server which is a good thing. You can read about the implementation here https://carstent.com/2018/10/25/sql-server-cell-column-field-level-encryption-handled-from-your-applications/.

The solution contains a class library with encryption functionality, as well as a few integration tests that shows how to use the class library.
